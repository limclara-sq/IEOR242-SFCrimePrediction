The code is separated into two folders, [preprocessing](preprocessing) and [modeling](modeling).

For the modelling files, they are to be in the following sequence: modeling.ipnyb and modeling II.ipnyb. The first notebook uses the daily dataset, and the second notebook extends upon the daily dataset by adding a binary feature of daytime/nighttime based on the sunrise and sunset timings, and a feature for time of day.
